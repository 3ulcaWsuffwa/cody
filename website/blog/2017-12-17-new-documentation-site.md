Today I'm happy to introduce the new documentation site for Cody!

The site is built using Facebook's newly released [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
tool for building documentation websites.

The intention is to have a place for both end-user documentation, as well as
documentation about configuring and deploying Cody for administrators. A lot of
this information is already present in the README on GitHub, but I think a
dedicated site will serve as a better way to present the information.
