## How to play multiplayer games
 
Many arcade games are designed for multiplayer mode, where you can play with or against other players. MAME 2.0 supports multiplayer games in two ways: local and online. Local multiplayer means that you can play with another person who has a GP2X Wiz and a copy of the same game. Online multiplayer means that you can play with other people over the internet who are using MAME 2.0 or other compatible emulators.
 
To play local multiplayer games on MAME 2.0, you need to connect your GP2X Wiz with another GP2X Wiz using a USB cable. Then you need to launch the same game on both devices and press the "Start" button at the same time. You should see a message saying "Link established" on both screens. Now you can play together as if you were using two arcade cabinets.
 
To play online multiplayer games on MAME 2.0, you need to have a Wi-Fi connection and an account on [Kali](https://www.kali.net/), a service that allows you to play online games with other users of retro emulators. You also need to download the Kali client for GP2X Wiz from [here](https://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/wiz.cgi?0,0,0,0,71). Once you have done that, you need to launch the Kali client on your GP2X Wiz and log in with your username and password. Then you need to launch MAME 2.0 and select the game you want to play online. You should see a list of servers and players who are playing the same game. You can join any server or create your own by pressing the "A" button.
